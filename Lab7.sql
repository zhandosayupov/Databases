-- 3. add not null constraints
alter table transactions alter column date set not null;
alter table customers alter column name set not null;
alter table accounts alter column currency set not null ;

--5
--index so that each customer can only have one account of one currency
create index src_am on accounts(customer_id, currency);
--index for searching transactions by currency and balance
create index cur_bal on accounts(currency, balance);

-- 6.
-- create transaction with "init" status
